      <p class="p2"> Hi! I'm Kathy. I'm currently a sophomore at Cornell University. I was born in NYC but grew up in Parsippany, NJ. </p>
      <p class="p2"> In Cornell, stuff. </p>
      <!-- <p class="p2"> Outside of school, I like hanging out with friends, playing piano, reading, watching TV, and traveling! I've been to Spain, Mexico, Hawaii, Italy, Rome, Greece, Great Britain, China, Japan, and HongKong. Whenever I visit someplace new, I feel as if I'm taking a step in a long journey. My parents immigrated from China because they wanted me to have a better life, and their hardships have shaped a part of my identity-- something I'm always reminded of when I go back to the Homeland. When I meet new people in new countries, I feel as though their interactions, no matter how small, stick with me for a long time afterwards. I've been raised to show empathy and compassion towards others and at heart, no matter what, I want to help people. </p> -->
      <!-- <p class="p2"> Sometimes I go through rough patches. Or I'm uncertain about things. Sometimes being uncertain about things makes me anxious. Things happen. But it's not the end of the world. I'm still trying to discover myself in college, and I've learned a lot so far and made a lot of new friends and new experiences. </p> -->
      <!-- <p class="p2"> I think I'm still going through my personal journey. Sometimes I forget what's good in life and I always remind myself that I've been really lucky to meet the people I've met and to have the opportunities I've had. Pushing myself closer to my goal and surrounding myself with the good things is what keeps me going. </p> -->
      <!-- <p class="p2">It's currently 3:30AM. Good night :) </p> -->
